Falling Star

Falling Star wants to be a game not unlike the old Zelda RPGs/Chrono 
Trigger/etc...

You are free to use the code however you want

BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT THE ASSETS ARE NOT MINE AND CANNOT BE USED 
COMMERCIALLY

Furthermore this is a personal project of mine that also serves as half 
my thesis for university.

Any and all advice/criticism/better ways to do stuff are always welcome.
Learning to make a game is fun!
